# Hi, I'm Tiernan Lindauer (T-Lind)!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a dual-degree student at Texas A&M University, pursuing BS degrees in **Computer Science** and **Physics** (with a perfect GPA). With experience in **machine learning**, **AI**, and **vector search technologies**, Iâ€™m passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology, particularly in the realms of **LLMs**, **reinforcement learning**, and **vector search**.

Check out my website at [t-lind.github.io](https://t-lind.github.io/) for more information. Trust me, it's worth it.
